Started in 1866 by the first transatlantic cable laid for financial globalization, financial technology has drastically evolved over the years. Giovanni Caselli was one of the first few inventors who made banking transactions develop into quicker, easier, and more accessible steps when he created the pantelegraph to verify these very transactions. After these developments sparked innovations and ideas as to how banking could be made easier, and the rest was history. However, the term financial technology was not coined until 127 years after it was developed. 

The true evolution of technology in the finances department began in the 1950s when the automated teller machine (ATM) and the credit card were born. Nowadays, faster transactions are made possible even with just a click on your mobile phone. Other companies have even made it more accessible by creating different mobile applications for on-the-go cashless transactions. All the way from Fintech 1.0, many countries have further developed their technology to come to where we are now: Fintech 3.5!
